# Exercises - Chapter 1: Introduction to Physical AI

## Conceptual Exercises

### Exercise 1.1: Digital vs Physical AI Comparison
Compare and contrast digital AI and Physical AI systems. List at least 5 key differences and explain why each difference matters for real-world applications.

### Exercise 1.2: Embodiment Analysis
Analyze a physical AI system of your choice (robot, autonomous vehicle, etc.) and explain how its physical form influences its cognitive capabilities. Identify specific examples of morphological computation in the system.

### Exercise 1.3: Sensor-Actuator Coordination
Describe a scenario where tight sensor-actuator coordination is critical for a Physical AI system's success. Explain what could go wrong if there were delays or mismatches in this coordination.

## Applied Exercises

### Exercise 1.4: Simple Physical Agent Extension
Extend the provided `simple_physical_agent.py` example to include:
1. Memory of visited locations
2. A more sophisticated obstacle avoidance algorithm
3. Energy consumption modeling

### Exercise 1.5: Physics Constraint Implementation
Modify the simple environment simulation to include basic physics constraints such as:
- Friction effects on movement
- Collision detection with momentum preservation
- Gravity effects for agents with mass

### Exercise 1.6: Multi-Agent Interaction
Design and implement a simple multi-agent system where two physical agents must coordinate to achieve a common goal in the same environment.

## Research Exercises

### Exercise 1.7: Real-World Application Study
Research and analyze a real-world Physical AI application (e.g., Boston Dynamics robots, Tesla Autopilot, Amazon warehouse robots). Write a 500-word report discussing:
- How the system embodies the Physical AI principles
- The key challenges it addresses
- Potential improvements based on recent advances in the field

### Exercise 1.8: Safety Considerations
Identify and discuss the top 5 safety considerations that must be addressed when deploying Physical AI systems in human-populated environments. Propose mitigation strategies for each consideration.

## Programming Challenge

### Exercise 1.9: Adaptive Behavior Implementation
Implement an adaptive behavior in the simple physical agent that allows it to learn from its environment over time. The agent should modify its behavior based on past experiences to improve its performance in similar situations.

**Requirements:**
- The agent should remember successful and unsuccessful actions
- It should adapt its strategy based on environmental feedback
- Include metrics to measure adaptation effectiveness

## Discussion Questions

1. How does the concept of embodiment challenge traditional AI architectures?
2. What are the main computational challenges in implementing real-time Physical AI systems?
3. Discuss the role of simulation in developing Physical AI systems and its limitations.
4. How might Physical AI systems change our understanding of intelligence itself?
5. What ethical considerations are unique to Physical AI systems compared to digital AI?

## Solutions Guidance

Partial solutions and hints for selected exercises are available in the instructor's manual. For programming exercises, focus on implementing core concepts rather than creating fully polished production code.
