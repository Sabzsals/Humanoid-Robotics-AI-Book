# Chapter 1: Introduction to Physical AI

Welcome to the fascinating world of Physical AI! This chapter introduces you to the fundamental concepts that bridge the gap between digital artificial intelligence and the physical world.

## Overview

Physical AI represents a paradigm shift from traditional AI that operates purely in digital spaces to AI systems that interact with and understand the physical world. Unlike conventional AI that processes data in abstract digital formats, Physical AI integrates sensing, actuation, and cognition to create intelligent systems that can perceive, reason about, and manipulate the physical environment.

## Key Concepts

Physical AI encompasses several key concepts that differentiate it from traditional AI:

1. **Embodied Cognition**: Intelligence emerges from the interaction between an agent and its environment
2. **Sensorimotor Integration**: Seamless combination of sensory input and motor output
3. **Real-time Processing**: Ability to respond to environmental changes in real-time
4. **Physics Understanding**: Comprehension of physical laws and constraints
5. **Material Interaction**: Capability to manipulate and work with physical materials
