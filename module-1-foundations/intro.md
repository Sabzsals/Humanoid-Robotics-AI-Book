# Module 1: Foundations of Physical AI

Welcome to the first module of "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: Embodied Intelligence in the Real World". This module establishes the foundational concepts that will guide your understanding of how artificial intelligence interfaces with the physical world.

## Overview

Module 1 consists of four chapters that progressively build your understanding of Physical AI:

1. **Chapter 1: Introduction to Physical AI** - Establishes the fundamental concepts distinguishing Physical AI from traditional digital AI systems
2. **Chapter 2: Embodied Intelligence** - Explores how intelligence emerges from the interaction between an agent and its environment
3. **Chapter 3: Sensors and Perception Systems** - Details the sensing mechanisms that enable Physical AI systems to understand their environment
4. **Chapter 4: Importance of Humanoid Robots** - Examines why humanoid form factors are significant in Physical AI development

## Learning Path

This module is designed for students with basic programming knowledge who want to understand the fundamentals of Physical AI and embodied intelligence. The content balances theoretical concepts with practical examples to prepare you for more advanced topics in subsequent modules.

Each chapter includes:
- Learning objectives to guide your study
- Conceptual explanations with real-world examples
- Technical depth sections for deeper understanding
- Exercises to reinforce key concepts
- Summaries to consolidate your learning

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Basic understanding of programming concepts
- Familiarity with fundamental mathematics (algebra, geometry)
- Interest in robotics and AI concepts

## Estimated Completion Time

This module should take approximately 10-12 hours to complete, depending on your background and how deeply you engage with the exercises.

## Next Steps

After completing this module, you'll have a solid foundation in Physical AI concepts and be prepared to explore robotics middleware, simulation environments, and AI brain architectures in the subsequent modules.
