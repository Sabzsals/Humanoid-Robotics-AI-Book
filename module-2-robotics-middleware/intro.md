# Module 2: Robotics Middleware

Welcome to Module 2 of "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: Embodied Intelligence in the Real World". This module introduces you to the critical infrastructure that enables complex robotics systems to function effectively.

## Overview

Module 2 explores the software frameworks and communication protocols that allow different components of a robotic system to work together seamlessly. The content covers industry-standard approaches to robotics software architecture.

Module 2 consists of four chapters:

1. **Chapter 5: Introduction to ROS 2** - Covers the fundamentals of the Robot Operating System version 2
2. **Chapter 6: Topics and Services** - Explores communication patterns in ROS 2
3. **Chapter 7: Writing Communication Nodes** - Provides hands-on experience creating ROS 2 nodes
4. **Chapter 8: Robot Description** - Details how robots are described and modeled in software

## Learning Path

This module is designed for developers with programming knowledge who want to learn robotics architecture and how to create communication nodes for robotic applications. The content emphasizes practical skills alongside theoretical understanding.

Each chapter includes:
- Learning objectives to guide your study
- Conceptual explanations with real-world examples
- Technical depth sections for deeper understanding
- Hands-on tutorials and code examples
- Exercises to reinforce key concepts
- Summaries to consolidate your learning

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Completed Module 1 (or have equivalent Physical AI knowledge)
- Basic programming skills in Python or C++
- Understanding of computer networking concepts
- Familiarity with Linux command line

## Estimated Completion Time

This module should take approximately 15-18 hours to complete, depending on your background and how deeply you engage with the hands-on exercises.

## Next Steps

After completing this module, you'll have the skills to develop communication systems for robotic applications and be prepared to explore simulation environments and control systems in Module 3.
