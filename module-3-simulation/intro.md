# Module 3: Simulation and Control

Welcome to Module 3 of "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: Embodied Intelligence in the Real World". This module focuses on simulation environments and control systems that allow us to develop and test Physical AI systems safely and efficiently.

## Overview

Module 3 addresses the critical role of simulation in Physical AI development, emphasizing safe robotics and simulation-first approaches. The content covers various simulation platforms and control strategies used in robotics.

Module 3 consists of four chapters:

1. **Chapter 9: Introduction to Simulation Environments** - Covers the fundamentals of robotics simulation
2. **Chapter 10: Gazebo and Ignition Simulation** - Explores popular simulation platforms for robotics
3. **Chapter 11: Robot Control Systems** - Details various approaches to controlling robotic systems
4. **Chapter 12: Simulation-Based Testing** - Focuses on how simulation is used for testing and validation

## Learning Path

This module is designed for students who want to understand how to simulate robotic systems and integrate AI planning systems. The emphasis is on safe learning through simulation before real-world deployment, following safety-first approaches.

Each chapter includes:
- Learning objectives to guide your study
- Conceptual explanations with real-world examples
- Technical depth sections for deeper understanding
- Simulation examples and configuration files
- Exercises to reinforce key concepts
- Summaries to consolidate your learning

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Completed Modules 1 and 2 (or have equivalent knowledge)
- Understanding of basic physics concepts
- Experience with programming and robotics middleware (ROS 2)
- Familiarity with Linux environment

## Estimated Completion Time

This module should take approximately 12-15 hours to complete, depending on your background and how deeply you engage with the simulation exercises.

## Next Steps

After completing this module, you'll have a solid understanding of simulation environments and control systems, preparing you to explore AI brains and autonomous humanoid systems in the final module.
