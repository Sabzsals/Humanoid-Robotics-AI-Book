# Module 4: AI Brains & Autonomous Humanoids

Welcome to the final module of "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: Embodied Intelligence in the Real World". This capstone module integrates all previous concepts to create autonomous humanoid systems that can operate independently in physical environments.

## Overview

Module 4 brings together all the concepts from previous modules to create complete autonomous systems. This module focuses on the AI components that make intelligent decisions and control humanoid robots in real-world scenarios.

Module 4 consists of four chapters:

1. **Chapter 13: AI Planning Systems** - Covers how autonomous systems plan and execute complex tasks
2. **Chapter 14: Vision-Language-Action Pipelines** - Explores how AI systems integrate perception, understanding, and action
3. **Chapter 15: Humanoid Locomotion and Control** - Details the specific challenges of controlling humanoid robots
4. **Chapter 16: Capstone: Simulated Humanoid System** - Integrates all concepts in a comprehensive project

## Learning Path

This module is designed for students who want to simulate autonomous humanoid robots and integrate AI planning systems. It represents the culmination of all concepts learned throughout the textbook, allowing you to understand how all components work together in a safe simulation environment.

Each chapter includes:
- Learning objectives to guide your study
- Conceptual explanations with real-world examples
- Technical depth sections for deeper understanding
- Advanced code examples and AI system designs
- Exercises to reinforce key concepts
- Summaries to consolidate your learning

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Completed all previous modules (or have equivalent knowledge)
- Strong programming skills in Python and ROS 2
- Understanding of AI and machine learning concepts
- Experience with simulation environments
- Knowledge of robotics control systems

## Estimated Completion Time

This module should take approximately 15-20 hours to complete, depending on your background and how deeply you engage with the capstone project.

## Capstone Project

The culminating experience of this module is the capstone project where you will create a simulated humanoid system that performs autonomous tasks. This project demonstrates your mastery of all concepts covered in the textbook.

## Conclusion

Upon completing this module, you will have a comprehensive understanding of Physical AI and humanoid robotics, with practical skills in creating autonomous systems that can operate in the real world.
